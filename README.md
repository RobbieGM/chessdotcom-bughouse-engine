# Chess.com Bughouse Engine

This injects code into the (now-defunct) chess.com/live interface to communicate with a local server running Stockfish. This allows the computer to play bughouse chess directly on chess.com without a human copying moves, as in bughouse time is critical. The engine achieved a performance rating of around 3800, much stronger than the strongest human players, but that says more about [the engine itself](https://github.com/ianfab/Fairy-Stockfish/) than this project!
